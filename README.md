### Installation

PyGoogalytics can be installed using pip:
```shell
pip install -U pygoogalytics
```

# Google Analytics API wrapper

`client.py` defines the class `Client` which builds `googleapiclient.discovery` resources for accessing 
Google Search Console and Google Analytics 3 (UA) data from the respective APIs, 
and also `google.analytics.data_v1beta.BetaAnalyticsDataClient` resource for accessing GA4 data, although 
currently this is only for testing.

Before using this python package you must [create a service account and download a JSON key file](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py#1_enable_the_api)
following the instructions from Google. This process will also give you a service account email address,
you need to add this email address to the user list for the Analytics or Search Console account for which you 
want to obtain data â€” you only need to give the service account "read" access. 

A `Client` class can create a `GoogalyticsWrapper` object which has methods to access data 
the Google services and return a pandas dataframe. 

A typical implementation will look like:
```python
from pygoogalytics.client import Client

googalytics_client = Client(key_file_path='<path-to-your-key-file>')
g_wrapper = googalytics_client.wrapper(
  sc_domain='<search-console-domain>', 
  view_id='<ga3-view-id>', 
  ga4_property_id='<ga4-property-id>'
)

ga3_dataframe = g_wrapper.get_df(
  result='GA3', 
  start_date='2023-01-01', 
  end_date='2023-01-07', 
  metrics=['ga:itemRevenue', 'ga:itemQuantity', 'ga:users'],
  dimensions=['ga:dateHourMinute', 'ga:landingPagePath', 'ga:sourceMedium', 'ga:countryIsoCode']
)
```

The `get_df` method accepts the following values for the `result` argument:
- "GSC": for Google Search Console data
- "GA3": for Google Analytics 3 (UA) data
- "URL": for Google Search Console URL inspection data
- "GA4": for Google Analytics 4 data (note, this is not yet available in production)


## Advantages of PyGoogalytics

1. When using the REST API for GA3 (UA) data one is allowed to request only 10 metrics at once. 
The PyGoogalytics wrapper allows the passing of any number of compatible dimensions and metrics,
when more than ten metrics are passed, the list is partitioned into sub-lists of length 10
and separate API calls are made for each partition, the resulting dataframes are then joined 
on the dimensions to create a seamless dataframe with all requested metrics.
2. Both the Search Console and GA3 APIs can return a maximum of 100k rows of data. The PyGoogalytics wrapper 
automatically paginates the requests and concatenates the results to return a dataframe of arbitrary length.

## Google Pandas

`googlepandas.py` provides the classes `GADataFrame` and `GSCDataFrame`, 
both children of pandas `DataFrame` specific to storing 
GA and GSC data with additional metadata fields 
(e.g. `dimensions` and `metrics`) and methods for adding columns 
and filtering by particular metrics.
